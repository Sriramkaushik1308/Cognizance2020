>## __Armstrong numbers__


>_Pseudo code for armstrong numbers_ 

Start

* __Declare__ 

    * *number* as integer
    * *num* as integer
    * *sum* as integer
    * *digit* as integer
* Use *number* to get __input__ from the user
* __Assign__ 

    * *num* = *number*
    * *sum* = 0
* Create a __while loop__ for the condition __*number* > 0__
* Inside the while loop , 
        
    * if the __while__ condition is true , then Assign

       *  *digit* = *number* % 10
       *  *sum* = *sum* + (*digit*)^3 
       *  *number* = *number*/10

    * if the __while__ condition is false , 
      
      * if *sum* == *num* is *true* , then give the number is __a Armstrong number__ as  __output__
      * if *sum* == *num* is *false* , then give the number is __not a Armstrong number__ as __output__

  End
