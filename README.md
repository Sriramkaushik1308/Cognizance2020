# ```PALINDROME ```
```__This is about finding a palindrome number__```


 ```First of all , what is a palindrome number ??```
  
  ```It is a number which will remain same , even when its digits are reversed...```

 ```We can understand, what is a palindrome just by seeing the number to and fro , but how can a computer know ??```

```But it can understsand, in code ...proper code ```

```Want to know how ?```
 
 ```Just dive into it...```

```U may ask , what are the advantages of this code , when we can see it by ourseves ??```
 ```there are advantages ```

* ```It can do it faster than us ```
* ```When the numbers become bigger , we can't see it , but they can understand it..```
* ```and the last , why we need to do , if they do it  for us ```

```ok, then what's the use of palindrome numbers ???```

```Well, It depends on you...```
